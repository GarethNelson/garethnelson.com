Home of Gareth Nelson
=====================

Welcome to my site, if you want to see my code please head to my `gogs install <https://www.garethnelson.com/git>`_ or my `github page <http://www.github.com/GarethNelson>`_ from which it mirrors.

I am not much of a social media type, but I do use twitter:

.. raw:: html

   <a class="twitter-timeline" data-width="300" data-height="400" data-theme="dark" href="https://twitter.com/garethnelson">Tweets by garethnelson</a> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br/>

Currently there is not a lot of other content here, but at some point there will be.
